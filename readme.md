# java_projects

This repository is a collection of Java projects I've made in my efforts to brush up on programming languages that I haven't touched in a long time, and to learn new ones. Java is the first programming language I ever learned, way back in 2012, and I never worked with it professionally.

Each project will have its own readme file containing post-coding notes.

Some notes:

- https://start.spring.io/ did not exist when I last worked with Spring and I'm very grateful for it
- Maven is just as annoying as it was the last time I worked with it :D
- I found Visual Studio Code to surprisingly work very well as a Java IDE

Contents, in order of creation:

1. spring_demo - This is simply the demo application from the spring.io quickstart guide with a few modifications
