# Post Coding Notes

- start.spring.io is pretty great
- Spring has a special `run` function that needs to be called from the `SpringAccplication` class in the main method.
- To see changes made to Spring code in the browser you seem to have to stop and start the application again. I don't like that.
- I copied the `hello` function aas `hello2` to mess around with how the String is returned. I learned that `String.format()` is how String interpolation is done in Java
- I coped the `hello` function as `meaningOfLife` to see what would happen if I changed the return type and removed request parameters. The function returns `42` in the browser as expected.
